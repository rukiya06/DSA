# Count Sort for Strings

This repository contains a Python implementation of Count Sort (Counting Sort) specifically designed to sort lowercase alphabetic strings. The algorithm counts the frequency of each character and then reconstructs the sorted string in alphabetical order.

---

## How it works

- Takes a single lowercase word as input.
- Uses a frequency array of size 26 (for letters a to z).
- Counts occurrences of each character.
- Rebuilds the sorted string by appending characters according to their counts.

Usage
Run the script.

Enter a single lowercase word when prompted.

See the original and sorted strings printed on the screen.
